# Tab-to-Comma-delimiter
Removes Tabs from a text file and replaces it with Commas to import into an excel spreadsheet 

rename the file you want to fix to "data.txt"
new data should appear in "newdatafile.txt"

only lines 6 to 10 are important, the rest is there just because I was bored and wanted to add some security

pip install time
pip install winsound

default password is "a", this can be changed to whatever you want.
